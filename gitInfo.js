/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitDefinition = "Git is version control software. It allows you to track your version history of a project locally, as well as pushing it to Github. Has a seemingly endless amount of documentation for commands that do things I can't even comprehend yet."

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitHubDefinition = "Basically cloud storage for all of your repositories. Can also view other peoples repositories, contributions, commits, etc."

//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

const init = {description : "initializes a local repository", code : "git init"} // must be in the directory you'd like to init

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////

    Create an object called 'clone' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the clone command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const clone = {description : "allows you to clone (copy /download) a repository on Github", code:"git clone <url> (optional: <newDirectory>)"}

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'status' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the status command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const status ={description: "doesn't do anything besides show you: changed files, untracked files, # of commits ahead"}
//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////

*/

//CODE HERE
const add = {description: "Tells git to start TRACKING files", code: "git add <fileName> // git add . to track all files in current directory"}

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
